## FIWARE Tour Guide Application - Docker image, Tampere Smart City edition

[FIWARE Tour Guide Application](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.TourGuide-App) is the sample application used in the [FIWARE Tour Guide](http://www.fiware.org/tour-guide/) to show real code working with the Generic Enablers integrated.

This image is intended to work together with [Orion](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/bitergia/fiware-orion/).

## Image contents

- [x] `ubuntu:14.04` baseimage available [here](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu/)
- [x] Node.js
- [x] REST interface for working with Orion

## Usage

We strongly suggest you to use [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). With docker compose you can define multiple containers in a single file, and link them easily.

So for this purpose, we have already a simple file that launches:

   * A MongoDB image with pre-loaded data
   * Orion Context Broker as a service
   * IDM Keyrock
   * PEP Proxy
   * Authzforce
   * IDAS
   * Cygnus
   * TourGuide app

The file `docker-compose.yml` can be downloaded from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fiware/tutorials.TourGuide-App/develop/docker-compose.yml).

Once you get it, you just have to pull the images:
```
docker-compose pull
```
And then start the containers:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

Note that even though the `docker-compose up -d` does also pull the images, we suggest to do it separately to avoid synchronization issues.

Also, there are several environment variables that you can configure in the [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fiware/tutorials.TourGuide-App/develop/docker-compose.yml):

   * `ORION_HOSTNAME`. Hostname of the Orion application protected by a proxy. By default the value is `pepwilma`
   * `ORION_NO_PROXY_HOSTNAME`. Hostname of the Orion application without proxy. By default the value is `orion`
   * `ORION_PORT`. Port of the Orion application. By default the value is `1026`
   * `ORION_PEP_ENABLED`. Activate the PEP Proxy. By default the value is `true`
   * `IDAS_PORT`. Port of the IDAS application. By default the value is `8080`
   * `SENSORS_GENERATION_ENABLED`. Enables sensors generation for each restaurant. By default the value is `false`.
   * `ORION_SUBSCRIPTIONS_ENABLED`. Activates the Orion sensors subscription, updating the Restaurant information. By default the value is `false`. **Note**: `SENSORS_GENERATION_ENABLED` must be set to `true`, otherwise there won't be sensors and no data will be generated.
   * `SENSORS_FORCED_UPDATE_ENABLED`. Updates the values of the sensors. By default the value is `false`. **Note**: `SENSORS_GENERATION_ENABLED` must be set to `true`, otherwise there won't be sensors and no data will be generated.

And all the services will be up. The client will be reachable at:

```
http://tourguide
```

End to end testing can be done using the [REST interface](http://docs.tourguide.apiary.io). An example application is [the restaurant data feeder](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.TourGuide-App/blob/develop/server/feeders/restaurantfeeder.js).

**Note**: to access the containers from the host (i.e http://tourguide/) you may need to modify your `hosts` file to add entries for the containers.  To help with this task, you can use the [get-docker-hosts](https://github.com/Bitergia/docker/tree/master/utils#get-docker-hosts) script to add or update the containers info to your `hosts` file.

## What if I don't want to use docker-compose?

No problem, the only thing is that you will have to deploy an Orion container yourself and configure its IP as Orion name inside the TourGuide container.

### Logs and other commands ###

By default, TourGuide show the logs from apache via `docker logs <container-id>` command.

If you need to run another command in the same container, you can use the `docker exec` command.

## IdM Users, Organizations, Apps, Roles and Permissions

This IdM image is intended to work with [Fiware TourGuide-App](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.TourGuide-App). Due to this, we've generated Users, Organizations, Apps, Roles and Permissions adapted to it in this uncoupled  [file](https://github.com/Fiware/tutorials.TourGuide-App/blob/develop/docker/images/tutorials.tourguide-app/keystone_provision.py).

**Note** the following provision is intended just for testing purposes. To add/remove information to this image, you can always use the [Identity API](http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-identity-v3.html)
